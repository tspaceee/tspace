# tspace


##Problem:
It’s difficult for a business to know if they hire a proper person or not. In any case, buyers try to find information about freelancers on the Internet to better know freelancers as a person. On the other hand, the freelancer should build a new profile on each freelancer platform.
##Solution:
##### T-space allows you to reuse your achievement in any public places and you can bind accounts. Design based on the opinion that if someone is active on these websites like StackOverflow, Github, Linkedin, Twitter, Youtube, etc. These sites can validate you very precisely. This public info helps to find strong shapes of freelancers.

##### The second aspect we should allow using current effective tools for money transfers for instance TransferWise, Revolute etc. To allow clients and freelancers to use any popular currency and save time and commission money.
##### The third aspect, using E-residency for digital sign any legal documents for instance NDA. T-space will have popular NDA examples and will help start a relationship securely and properly.
##### The Four aspect We think it’s okay when customers and freelancers work directly and don’t need to pay more money on other services. But if you focus one your tech skills T-space will take a fare commission of 5% to protect your rights.
##### T-space is focusing to make relationships between contractors and freelancers easier, safer, and transparent.
